# PolyLlama: An Intelligent information extraction pipeline driven by large language model for building polymer processing database

    The literature contains a wealth of data related to polymer processing, which holds a crucial position in the field of polymer materials, since the properties of polymeric product is highly dependent on processing due to its soft matter characteristics. However, existing methods for extracting related data from scientific literature face challenges due to the highly variable descriptions of technical workflows and the abundance of specialized terminology in this field. In this work, we develop an automated extraction tool powered by large language models designed specifically to support the creation of a polymer processing database, and injection molding has been chosen as an example. By utilizing 4-bit NormalFloat Quantized large language models and Low-Rank Adapter fine-tuning techniques, we have integrated knowledge of the injection molding process into the internals of large language model, enhancing its professional insights. Finally, the key parameters of polymer injection molding were extracted from the relevant literatures, and our approach delivers an accuracy of 91.1% on a test dataset. This work provides a computationally efficient reference with highly adaptable to linguistic flexibility for data extraction in the area of polymer processing, especially in injection molding, with substantial potential to efficiently construct polymer processing database.
